# Pinterest Image Buttons

Adds an extension to the image object that lets you place a pinterest share button to share a high resolution version of the image.

To add a pinterest button next to your image you just have to add the following line in you template:

```
$Image.PlacePinterestButton
```

## Todo

Currently the module depends on fontawesome for the pinterest icon, but future version will contain some sort of configuarable icon styles.
